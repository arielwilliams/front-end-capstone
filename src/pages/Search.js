// notes: we will need an input field wrapped in form field and an event listener for on form submit
// when user clicks the submit button then hit the yelp API once for those suggestions
// if user wants to add a restaurant to their list they would have the option to create a new list or add to existing list.
// THEN, that restaurant will get saved to the BE database.

// UNLESS WE WANT SEARCH SUGGESTIONS (that would be on key down... which would probs be more work)
